Hiking with Pack 818 Wolves!!<br>
10AM in Eaton Canyon, in Pasadena.  There may be water crossing, advisable to wear shoes that can get wet.

Thes hike satisfied the following requirements for the Tigers in the Wild Adventure, with the page numbers they can be found in the scout's tiger book:
* requirement 1 (pg. 96) - 6 hiking essentials (if your tiger assisted in going over them this is done, or you can review them with your tiger)
* requirement 2 (pg 97) 
* requirement 3A (pg 98) - we went over this on the way back
* requirement 3B (pg 99) - we went over this on the way back
* requirement 3C (pg 100) - the boys picked up trash/cleaned the trail on the way back, they were respectful of the injured deer & other wildlife


The following requirements can be done using the hike, having your tiger fill out these pages:
* requirement 4 (pg 102) - write down 3 plants, birds, or animals you saw on the hike
* requirement 6 (pg 105) - list and draw 2 plants and 2 trees that live in your area.  Your tiger can use anything they saw on the hike, or they can simply list any that they know (trees or plants growing in your yard, etc.)
* requirement 7 (pg 106) - visit a nature center.  The boys loved all the animals at the nature center, they just need to write down the name of the center (Eaton Canyon nature center), 2 animals they learned about, and two interesting facts about those 2 animals.  Since the boys explored it on their own for the most part if they can list any animals they saw you can help them with the interesting facts if needed.

Once 4,6, and 7 from above are filled out in the book, that only leaves requirement 5 to complete the tigers in the wild adventure.  Requirement 5 is doing a skit for the pack, stay tuned.
