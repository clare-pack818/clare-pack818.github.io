The Rancho Santa Ana Botanical Garden hosts its annual Fall Planting Day, with FREE Admission.  The Garden is open from 8am - 5pm.  

We will walk through the gardens looking to identify 2 birds, do a "1-foot-hike" and record what we find, and listen for sounds (Adventure requirements 1, 2, and 5 of the "Backyard Jungle" Adventure).
