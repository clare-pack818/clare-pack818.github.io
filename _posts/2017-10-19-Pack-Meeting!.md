This will be our 2nd Pack Meeting!  We will be joining the Wolf Den in singning a song for the pack (google "I lava you" for the song).  The meeting is at 7pm at Temple Beth Israel in Pomona, please arrive at least 15 minutes early to allow the boys to rehearse.  

Also, please have your boys bring their tiger books!  We can check off what they have completed, and after they have performed the skit they will be able to obtain their Tigers in the Wild Loop!

Requirements completed:
* Requirement 5 of tigers in the wild adventure (perform a skit/song for your pack)
